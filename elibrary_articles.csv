DECOUPLED EDGE PHYSICS ALGORITHMS FOR COLLABORATIVE XR SIMULATIONS,2024,статья в журнале - научная статья,"ABSTRACT. This work proposes a novel approach to transform any modern game engine pipeline, for optimized performance and enhanced user experiences in extended reality (XR) environments decoupling the physics engine from the game engine pipeline and using a client-server architecture creates a scalable solution, efficiently serving multiple graphics clients on head-mounted displays (HMDs) with a single physics engine on edge-cloud infrastructure. This approach ensures better synchronization in multiplayer scenarios without introducing overhead in single-player experiences, maintaining session continuity despite changes in user participation. Relocating the Physics Engine to an edge or cloud node reduces strain on local hardware, dedicating more resources to high-quality rendering and unlocking the full potential of untethered HMDs. We present four algorithms that decouple the physics engine, increasing frame rates and Quality of Experience (QoE) in VR simulations, supporting advanced interactions, numerous physics objects, and multiuser sessions with over 100 concurrent users...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=79583170

AN EFFICIENT SYNCHRONIZATION MECHANISM FOR MIRRORED GAME ARCHITECTURES,2004,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Existing online multiplayer games typically use a client-server model, which introduces added latency as well as a single bottleneck and single point of failure to the game. Distributed multiplayer games minimize latency and remove the bottleneck, but require special synchronization mechanisms to provide a consistent game for all players. Current synchronization methods have been borrowed from distributed military simulations and are not optimized for the requirements of fast-paced multiplayer games. In this paper we present a new synchronization mechanism, trailing state synchronization (TSS), which is designed around the requirements of distributed first-person shooter games. We look at TSS in the environment of a mirrored game architecture , which is a hybrid between traditional centralized architectures and the more scalable peer-to-peer architectures. Mirrored architectures allow for improved performance compared to client-server architectures while at the same time allowing for a greater degree of centralized administration than peer-to-peer architectures. We evaluate the performance of TSS and other synchronization methods through simulation and examine heuristics for selecting the synchronization delays needed for TSS.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=6516973

INCORPORATING PERSONALIZED LEARNING IN A ROLE-PLAYING GAME ENVIRONMENT VIA SID MODEL: A PILOT STUDY OF IMPACT ON LEARNING PERFORMANCE AND COGNITIVE LOAD,2022,статья в журнале - научная статья,"While role-playing games and personalized learning have been regarded as effective tools to improve students’ learning, incorporating personalized learning into role-playing games is challenging and approaches are limited to cognitive and motivational variables. Aiming at expanding approaches to incorporate personalization into role-playing games, this study included affective and cognitive variables to develop a personalized role-playing game, guiding by the situational design model. A pilot study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the game on students’ learning performance and cognitive load. Results showed that personalized role-playing game environment was effective in improving students’ performance, reducing extraneous load, and promoting germane load. This study also found that although decreased extraneous load, could leave students more GL capacity for efficient learning, this would not necessarily lead to performance improvement. Students need to be motivated to invest sufficient germane load to actively process the learning materials and thus, improve performance. The findings have several implications for future research designing personalized educational games aimed to promote efficient learning.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52075111
P2P MATCHMAKING SOLUTION FOR ONLINE GAMES,2020,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Matchmaking players is an important problem in online multiplayer games. Existing solutions employ client-server architecture, which induces several problems. Those range from additional costs associated with infrastructure maintenance to inability to play the game once servers become unavailabe (due to being under Denial of Service attack or being shut down after earning enough profit). This paper aims to provide a solution for the problem of matchmaking players on the scale of the Internet, without using a central server. In order to achieve this goal, the SelfAid platform for building custom P2P matchmaking strategies is presented. After the developer creates a service algorithm defining the matchmaking behavior specific to his/hers case, the SelfAid platform designates a number of player machines to execute the service. Furthermore, the number of designated machines adapts to the demand. SelfAid uses only spare resources of player machines, following the trend of sharing economy. A distributed algorithm is presented and its correctness is proven.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52903817

AN EXPLORATION FROM VIRTUAL TO AUGMENTED REALITY GAMING,2006,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Computer games are continuously improving graphics capabilities and game play, but the market demands show that more compelling gaming applications are required. In this article, the requirements of modern gaming applications are investigated and a classification of the most significant game design issues is presented. To understand the issues related to video and virtual reality gaming, an interactive game engine is designed and, as a case study, a traditional two-dimensional arcade game, called Breakout, is ported. Collision detection is supported between the graphics components of the application based on Newtonian laws of physics.

ORGANIZING INNOVATIVE PROJECTS TO INTERACT WITH MARKET DYNAMICS: - A COEVOLUTIONARY APPROACH,2003,статья в журнале - научная статья,"This paper is about the coevolutionary processes that take place between the way firms organize their innovative activities and the dynamics of the relevant markets, especially those having to do with bandwagon and network effects. We focus on the decision-making actors and propose a categorization of causes of increasing returns and definitions of bandwagon and network effects that are consistent with this aim. We investigate the extent of internal autonomy of the unit, the extent of the integration of R&D, production and other activities in the product development process, and the extent of external autonomy. Based on three cases of projects creating software products, two of them in the same firm, we develop hypotheses concerning the relation between the organization of innovation and bandwagon and network effects.

"ROAM, A SEAMLESS APPLICATION FRAMEWORK",2004,статья в журнале - научная статья,"One of the biggest challenges in future application development is device heterogeneity. In the future, we expect to see a rich variety of computing devices that can run applications. These devices have different capabilities in processors, memory, networking, screen sizes, input methods, and software libraries. We also expect that future users are likely to own many types of devices. Depending on users' changing situations and environments, they may choose to switch from one type of device to another that brings the best combination of application functionality and device mobility (size, weight, etc.). Based on this scenario, we have designed and implemented a seamless application framework called the Roam system that can both assist developers to build multi-platform applications that can run on heterogeneous devices and allow a user to move/migrate a running application among heterogeneous devices in an effortless manner. The Roam system is based on partitioning of an application into components and it automatically selects the most appropriate adaptation strategy at the component level for a target platform...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=5122463
CONTEXTUAL VIRTUAL INTERACTION AS PART OF UBIQUITOUS GAME DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT,2002,статья в журнале - научная статья,"This paper relates to the problems of designing rich interaction, in the context of multi-player games, that would adequately support communication, control and co-ordination. The aspects of fun and rich experiences, usually required within the entertainment context, are easily overlooked in technologically driven system design. The concepts of a future ubiquitous game can be difficult to comprehend and evaluate in cases where a fully functioning physical prototype is not an option. One solution for the problem is Contextual Virtual Reality Prototyping that adds the missing context to the design simulations. The product can be designed and demonstrated in the corresponding environment, thus making it easier to understand the use-cases of, for example, a mobile device that has various location-dependent features. The main contribution of this research is the design and development approach that supports the creation of rich interaction. The primary emphasis of the approach is to avoid purely technologically driven design and development, but rather to provide a supporting, or even a guiding, approach that focuses on the creative process and conceptual understanding of rich interaction. This conceptually grounded content production-oriented approach to interactive system design is described and evaluated.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=1379308

LOW-COST VIRTUAL REALITY ENVIRONMENT FOR ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION,2016,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Presenting significant building or engineering 3D-models is a crucial part of the planning, construction and maintenance phases in terms of collaboration and understanding. Especially in complex or large-scale models, immersion is one of the major key factors for being able to intuitively perceive all aspects of the scene. A fully immersive system needs to give the user a large field-of-view with reduced latency for lifelike impression. Technologies such as VRwalls and shutter glasses can deliver high refresh rates, yet fail to give a large field-of-view. Head-mounted-devices for virtual reality fill this gap. Head tracking mechanisms translate movements of the user’s head into virtual camera movements and enable a natural way of examining models. Unlike a stereoscopic representation with projectors, point-of-view tracking can be achieved separately for each individual user. Hardware costs for such systems were very high in the past, but have dropped due to virtual reality systems now gaining traction in the mainstream gaming community...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52008076
NARRATIVE BALANCE MANAGEMENT IN AN INTELLIGENT BIOSAFETY TRAINING APPLICATION FOR IMPROVING USER PERFORMANCE,2015,статья в журнале - научная статья,"The use of three-dimensional virtual environments in training applications supports the simulation of complex scenarios and realistic object behaviour. While these environments have the potential to provide an advanced training experience to students, it is difficult to design and manage a training session in real time due to the number of parameters to pay attention to: timing of events, difficulty, user’s actions and their consequences or eventualities are some examples. For that purpose, we have extended our virtual Bio-safety Laboratory application used for training biohazard procedures with a Narrative Manager. The Narrative Manager controls the simulation deciding which events will take place in the simulation, and when, by controlling the narrative balance of the session. Our hypothesis is that the Narrative Manager allows us to increase the number of tasks for the user to solve and, due to balancing difficulty and intensity, it keeps the user interested in training. When evaluating our system we observed that the Narrative Manager effectively introduces more tasks for the user to solve, and despite that, is accepted by the users as more interesting and not harder than an identical system without a Narrative Manager. Also, a knowledge test demonstrated better results in users’ interest and learning output in the narrative condition.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52323350

EMOTECONTROL: AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR REAL-TIME CONTROL OF EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION IN MUSIC,2021,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Several computer systems have been designed for music emotion research that aim to identify how different structural or expressive cues of music influence the emotions conveyed by the music. However, most systems either operate offline by pre-rendering different variations of the music or operate in real-time but focus mostly on structural cues. We present a new interactive system called EmoteControl, which allows users to make changes to both structural and expressive cues (tempo, pitch, dynamics, articulation, brightness, and mode) of music in real-time. The purpose is to allow scholars to probe a variety of cues of emotional expression from non-expert participants who are unable to articulate or perform their expression of music in other ways. The benefits of the interactive system are particularly important in this topic as it offers a massive parameter space of emotion cues and levels for each emotion which is challenging to exhaustively explore without a dynamic system...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52839581

COMPUTATIONAL DRAFTING OF PLOT STRUCTURES FOR RUSSIAN FOLK TALES,2016,статья в журнале - научная статья,"The plots of stories are known to follow general patterns in terms of their overall structure. This was the basic tenet of structuralist approaches to narratology. Vladimir Propp proposed a procedure for the generation of new tales based on his semi-formal description of the structure of Russian folk tales. This is one of the first existing instances of a creative process described procedurally. The present paper revisits Propp’s morphology to build a system that generates instances of Russian folk tales. Propp’s view of the folk tale as a rigid sequence of character functions is employed as a plot driver, and some issues that Propp declared relevant but did not explore in detail—such as long-range dependencies between functions or the importance of endings—are given computational shape in the context of a broader architecture that captures all the aspects discussed by Propp. A set of simple evaluation metrics for the resulting outputs is defined inspired on Propp’s formalism.

HUGOS: A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDYING COLLECTIVE HUMAN BEHAVIOR FROM A SWARM INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE,2021,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Swarm intelligence studies self-organized collective behavior resulting from interactions between individuals, typically in animals and artificial agents. Some studies from cognitive science have also demonstrated self-organization mechanisms in humans, often in pairs. Further research into the topic of human swarm intelligence could provide a better understanding of new behaviors and larger human collectives. This requires studies with multiple human participants in controlled experiments in a wide variety of scenarios, where a rich scope of possible interactions can be isolated and captured. In this paper, we present HuGoS—‘Humans Go Swarming’—a multi-user virtual environment implemented using the Unity game development platform, as a comprehensive tool for experimentation in human swarm intelligence. We demonstrate the functionality of HuGoS with naïve participants in a browser-based implementation, in a coordination task involving collective decision-making, messaging and signaling, and stigmergy.

LOCAL PERFORMANCE NETWORKS: MUSICAL INTERDEPENDENCY THROUGH GESTURES AND CONTROLLERS,2005,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Informed by a proposed theoretical framework for the field of interconnected musical networks (Weinberg 2005), I describe a set of local musical networks that utilise novel gestural controllers for interdependent collaborative performance. The paper begins by contextualising developments in the field of musical networks in correlation with development of technological innovations, leading to the utilisations of gestural controllers in local musical networks. This introduction leads to the definition and categorisation of theoretical and practical approaches for the design of local gestural networks, addressing motivations, social strategies, network architectures, musical content, and control software and hardware. Based on this theoretical framework I describe the evolution of four local musical networks that utilise newly developed gestural controllers, titled 'Squeezables', 'Musical Fireflies', 'Beatbugs' and 'Voice Patterns'. The paper discusses the design and development process of these projects and ends with a comparative analysis of the networks and controllers based on conceptual and practical criteria.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=9123038

ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ENERGY SAVING TECHNIQUES IN CLOUD SERVER,2020,статья в журнале - научная статья,"In recent years, lot of research has been carried in the field of cloud computing and distributed systems to investigate and understand their performance. Economic impact of energy consumption is of major concern for major companies. Cloud Computing companies (Google, Yahoo, Gaikai, ONLIVE, Amazon and eBay) use large data centers which are comprised of virtual computers that are placed globally and require a lot of power cost to maintain. Demand for energy consumption is increasing day by day in IT firms. Therefore, Cloud Computing companies face challenges towards the economic impact in terms of power costs. Energy consumption is dependent upon several factors, e.g., service level agreement, virtual machine selection techniques, optimization policies, workload types etc. We address a solution for the energy saving problem by enabling dynamic voltage and frequency scaling technique for gaming data centers. The dynamic voltage and frequency scaling technique is compared against non-power aware and static threshold detection techniques...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=53029727
A STORYTELLING-DRIVEN FRAMEWORK FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE DISSEMINATION,2016,статья в журнале - научная статья,"This paper aims at introducing a new dissemination framework for cultural heritage (CH) making possible affordable solutions for small and medium museums to cooperate/collaborate in the creation of exhibitions. The framework also makes possible new data-based communication strategies able to combine content belonging to different cultural archives and accessed through an ontology-based integration and discovery mechanism, and fosters new data sharing and distribution policies that preserve intellectual property rights. The proposed dissemination model redefines the concept of digital storytelling with the aim of increasing the participation of domain experts in the dissemination of CH. The framework is designed around a graph-based architecture for creating attractive and engaging multimedia narratives that will be transformed in real experiences personalized according to the user’s profile, interests and context of use.

NEGOTIATE YOUR FUTURE: WEB-BASED ROLE PLAY,2004,статья в журнале - научная статья,"An original concept for a Web-based role play ""SurfingGlobalChange"" is proposed on the basis of multi-year interdisciplinary teaching experience and constructivist pedagogy. Underlying didactic orientation is towards self-guided learning, acquiring socially compatible ""competence to act"" in a globalised world, self-optimising social procedures inside teams, process-orientation and peer-review instead of teacher's review. Participating students find themselves in an argumentative battle where they put their marks at stake.

"THE PERCEPTIVE WORKBENCH: COMPUTER-VISION-BASED GESTURE TRACKING, OBJECT TRACKING, AND 3D RECONSTRUCTION FOR AUGMENTED DESKS",2003,статья в журнале - научная статья,"The Perceptive Workbench endeavors to create a spontaneous and unimpeded interface between the physical and virtual worlds. Its vision-based methods for interaction constitute an alternative to wired input devices and tethered tracking. Objects are recognized and tracked when placed on the display surface. By using multiple infrared light sources, the object's 3-D shape can be captured and inserted into the virtual interface. This ability permits spontaneity, since either preloaded objects or those objects selected at run-time by the user can become physical icons. Integrated into the same vision-based interface is the ability to identify 3-D hand position, pointing direction, and sweeping arm gestures. Such gestures can enhance selection, manipulation, and navigation tasks. The Perceptive Workbench has been used for a variety of applications, including augmented reality gaming and terrain navigation. This paper focuses on the techniques used in implementing the Perceptive Workbench and the system's performance.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=5081844

TIMELINES: SIMPLIFYING THE PROGRAMMING OF LAG COMPENSATION FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF NETWORKED GAMES,2013,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Lag compensation algorithms used in networked games require programmers to manage the complexities of dealing with both time and shared state. This can make implementing lag compensation techniques challenging. The difficulties in expressing these algorithms limit experimentation with different algorithms and inhibit programmers from exploring the space of the algorithms and testing their effects. The solution is to have a programming model that is better able to deal with time. In this paper, we present such a programming model, timelines. Timelines dramatically reduce the time and effort required to implement lag compensation techniques by allowing for the explicit treatment of time. The timelines model has been implemented as part of the Janus toolkit.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52487625

ADDING COMMUNICATIVE AND AFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO AN EMBODIED CONVERSATIONAL AGENT TO ENHANCE SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNERS’ WILLINGNESS TO COMMUNICATE,2019,статья в журнале - научная статья,"This paper describes an embodied conversational agent enhanced with specific conversational strategies aiming to foster learners’ readiness towards communication in a second language (L2). Willingness to communicate (WTC) in a second language is believed to have a direct and sustained influence on learners’ actual usage frequency of the target language. To help overcome the lack of suitable environments for increasing L2 learners’ WTC, our approach is to build embodied conversational agents that can help learners surmount their apprehension towards communication in L2. Here, we focus on the dialogue management aspects of our approach and propose a model based on a set of communication strategies (CS) and affective backchannels (AB) to foster such agents’ ability to carry on natural and WTC-friendly conversations with learners. We examined learners’ expected WTC after interacting with one of the following versions of the system: an agent featuring both CS and AB; an agent featuring only CS; and an agent featuring only AB...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=51766568
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A METAVERSE PLATFORM FOR TRADITIONAL CULTURE: THE CHIME BELLS OF MARQUIS YI OF ZENG,2022,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Metaverse platforms have become increasingly prevalent for collaboration in virtual environments. Metaverse platforms, as opposed to virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality, expand with enhanced social meanings within virtual worlds. The research object in this study is the chime bells of Marquis Yi of Zeng, one of China's most treasured cultural heritage sites. We aimed to create a metaverse platform for the chime bells of Marquis Yi of Zeng to provide visitors with a highly immersive and interactive experience. First, we collected the materials and data of the chime bells and other exhibits, as well as historical information. Then, the data were processed and integrated for 3D model reconstruction. In addition, we designed the virtual roaming system through which visitors could interact with the exhibits to obtain multimedia information and even knock to ring the chime bells. Finally, we built our system to connect multiple visitors in different geographic locations and encourage them to collaborate and communicate within the virtual space. This platform helps users visualize cultural heritage, simulates real-life tour experiences with intuitive manners of interaction, and motivates visitors’ interest in traditional culture. This research also reveals the potential use of metaverse-related techniques in cultural heritage sectors.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=51847479

INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS BY AND FOR THE DEVELOPING WORLD: A REVIEW OF TRENDS AND APPROACHES FOR EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT,2015,статья в журнале - научная статья,"As information and communication technology access expands in the developing world, learning technologies have the opportunity to play a growing role to enhance and supplement strained educational systems. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) offer strong learning gains, but are a class of technology traditionally designed for most-developed countries. Recently, closer consideration has been made to ITS targeting the developing world and to culturally-adapted ITS. This paper presents findings from a systematic literature review that focused on barriers to ITS adoption in the developing world. While ITS were the primary focus of the review, the implications likely apply to a broader range of educational technology as well. The geographical and economic landscape of tutoring publications is mapped out, to determine where tutoring systems research occurs. Next, the paper discusses challenges and promising solutions for barriers to ITS within both formal and informal settings...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52242561
BALANCING THE PLAYING FIELD: COLLABORATIVE GAMING FOR PHYSICAL TRAINING,2017,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Multiplayer video games promoting exercise-based rehabilitation may facilitate motor learning, by increasing motivation through social interaction. However, a major design challenge is to enable meaningful inter-subject interaction, whilst allowing for significant skill differences between players. We present a novel motor-training paradigm that allows real-time collaboration and performance enhancement, across a wide range of inter-subject skill mismatches, including disabled vs. able-bodied partnerships. A virtual task consisting of a dynamic ball on a beam, is controlled at each end using independent digital force-sensing handgrips. Interaction is mediated through simulated physical coupling and locally-redundant control. Game performance was measured in 16 healthy-healthy and 16 patient-expert dyads, where patients were hemiparetic stroke survivors using their impaired arm. Dual-player was compared to single-player performance, in terms of score, target tracking, stability, effort and smoothness; and questionnaires probing user-experience and engagement...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=53085991
G4D - A TREASURE HUNT GAME FOR NOVICE PROGRAMMERS TO LEARN DEBUGGING,2020,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Visual Programming Environments (VPEs) are predominantly being used to teach programming concepts through interactive games with interesting narratives. Games have been developed to teach basic concepts of programming such as deriving logic, writing code, debugging the code and so on. Debugging code is one of the most important activities that can improve the skill of tackling a problem. In programming, one needs to identify the correct location of an error and fix it, which is usually learned through experience. Games have been developed to teach debugging to novice programmers. Syntactical errors occur frequently in the early stages of programming. The existing debugging games aim to support users in debugging the logic of the problem, but do not target on correcting the code snippets based on syntax. To address this challenge of providing syntactical support, we propose a treasure hunt based debugging game, in which users pass through various levels of the game by debugging code snippets written in C language. We have evaluated G4D based on MEEGA+ model, with 20 volunteers, having different programming backgrounds. The results of the user survey indicate that G4D has a good quality level and about 75% of the volunteers have either strongly agreed or agreed to recommend G4D to their colleagues.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=53015698
BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED REAL-TIME SLA MONITORING FOR CLOUD-HOSTED SERVICES,2022,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Cloud computing is an important technology for businesses and individual users to obtain computing resources over the Internet on-demand and flexibly. Although cloud computing has been adopted across diverse applications, the owners of time-and-performance critical applications require cloud service providers’ guarantees about their services, such as availability and response times. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are a mechanism to communicate and enforce such guarantees typically represented as service level objectives (SLOs), and financial penalties are imposed on SLO violations. Due to delays and inaccuracies caused by manual processing, an automatic method to periodically verify SLA terms in a transparent and trustworthy manner is fundamental to effective SLA monitoring, leading to the acceptance and credibility of such service to the customers of cloud services. This paper presents a blockchain-based distributed infrastructure that leverages fundamental blockchain properties to achieve immutable and trustworthy SLA monitoring within cloud services...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52590563
THE CONTRACT AS SOCIAL ARTIFACT,2003,статья в журнале - научная статья,"This article outlines a distinctive, albeit not entirely unprecedented, research agenda for the sociolegal study of contracts. In the past, law and society scholars have tended to examine contracts either through the intellectual history of contract doctrine ""on the books"" or through the empirical study of how real-world exchange relations are governed ""in action."" Although both of these traditions have contributed greatly to our understanding of contract law, neither has devoted much attention to the most distinctive concrete product of contractual transactions-contract documents themselves. Without denying the value of studying either contract doctrine or relational governance, this article argues that contract documents are independently interesting social artifacts and that they should be studied as such. As social artifacts, contracts possess both technical and symbolic properties, and the sociolegal study of contract-as-artifact can profitably apply prevailing social scientific theories of technology and symbolism to understand both: (1) the microdynamics of why and how transacting parties craft individual contract devices, and (2) the macrodynamics of why and how larger social systems generate and sustain distinctive contract regimes...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=1497596
REPRESENTATIONS AND SOLUTIONS FOR GAME-THEORETIC PROBLEMS,1997,статья в журнале - научная статья,"A system with multiple interacting agents (whether artificial or human) is often best analyzed using game-theoretic tools. Unfortunately, while the formal foundations are well-established, standard computational techniques for game-theoretic reasoning are inadequate for dealing with realistic games. This paper describes the Gala system, an implemented system that allows the specification and efficient solution of large imperfect information games. The system contains the first implementation of a recent algorithm, due to Koller, Megiddo and von Stengel. Experimental results from the system demonstrate that the algorithm is exponentially faster than the standard algorithm in practice, not just in theory. It therefore allows the solution of games that are orders of magnitude larger than were previously possible. The system also provides a new declarative language for compactly and naturally representing games by their rules. As a whole, the Gala system provides the capability for automated game-theoretic analysis of complex real-world situations.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=261380
MAD CITY MYSTERY: DEVELOPING SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTATION SKILLS WITH A PLACE-BASED AUGMENTED REALITY GAME ON HANDHELD COMPUTERS,2007,статья в журнале - научная статья,"While the knowledge economy has reshaped the world, schools lag behind in producing appropriate learning for this social change. Science education needs to prepare students for a future world in which multiple representations are the norm and adults are required to “think like scientists.” Location-based augmented reality games offer an opportunity to create a “post-progressive” pedagogy in which students are not only immersed in authentic scientific inquiry, but also required to perform in adult scientific discourses. This cross-case comparison as a component of a design-based research study investigates three cases (roughly 28 students total) where an Augmented Reality curriculum, Mad City Mystery, was used to support learning in environmental science. We investigate whether augmented reality games on handhelds can be used to engage students in scientific thinking (particularly argumentation), how game structures affect students’ thinking, the impact of role playing on learning, and the role of the physical environment in shaping learning...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52634286
"SEMANTIC MEMORY: A REVIEW OF METHODS, MODELS, AND CURRENT CHALLENGES",2021,статья в журнале - научная статья,"Adult semantic memory has been traditionally conceptualized as a relatively static memory system that consists of knowledge about the world, concepts, and symbols. Considerable work in the past few decades has challenged this static view of semantic memory, and instead proposed a more fluid and flexible system that is sensitive to context, task demands, and perceptual and sensorimotor information from the environment. This paper (1) reviews traditional and modern computational models of semantic memory, within the umbrella of network (free association-based), feature (property generation norms-based), and distributional semantic (natural language corpora-based) models, (2) discusses the contribution of these models to important debates in the literature regarding knowledge representation (localist vs. distributed representations) and learning (error-free/Hebbian learning vs. error-driven/predictive learning), and (3) evaluates how modern computational models (neural network, retrieval-based, and topic models) are revisiting the traditional “static” conceptualization of semantic memory and tackling important challenges in semantic modeling such as addressing temporal, contextual, and attentional influences, as well as incorporating grounding and compositionality into semantic representations...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52033750

THE CONCEPT OF ‘WORK’ IN CSCW,2011,статья в журнале - научная статья,"The scope of CSCW, its focus on work, has been a topic of sporadic debate for many years — indeed, from the very beginning in the late 1980s. But in recent years the issue has become one of general concern. Most of this debate has been taking place in closed fora such as program committees, editorial boards, and email discussion groups, but over the last few years the debate has been brought out in the open in a few publications, in particular in a programmatic article from 2005 by three esteemed CSCW researchers: Andy Crabtree, Tom Rodden, and Steve Benford. They argue that CSCW should ‘move its focus away from work’. Other researchers argue along the same lines. Taking this open challenge as a welcome cue, the present article addresses CSCW’s scope: the rationale for its focus on ordinary work. After an initial discussion of the arguments put forward by Crabtree et al. and by others, the article focuses on an analysis of the concept of ‘work’, drawing on the methods and insights of ‘ordinary language philosophy’, and, flowing from this, a critique of the notion of ‘work’ in conversation analysis. After a critical appraisal of prevailing myths about the realities of work in the contemporary world, the article ends in an attempt to position CSCW in the context of technological development more broadly. The underlying premise of the article is that it is time to reconsider CSCW: to rethink what it is and why it might be important.",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52551384
