DECOUPLED EDGE PHYSICS ALGORITHMS FOR COLLABORATIVE XR SIMULATIONS,"Kokiadis G., Protopsaltis A., Morfiadakis M., Lydatakis N., Papagiannakis G.",2024,6,,,Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds . 2024. Т. 35. № 6 .,"ABSTRACT. This work proposes a novel approach to transform any modern game engine pipeline, for optimized performance and enhanced user experiences in extended reality (XR) environments decoupling the physics engine from the game engine pipeline and using a client-server architecture creates a scalable solution, efficiently serving multiple graphics clients on head-mounted displays (HMDs) with a single physics engine on edge-cloud infrastructure. This approach ensures better synchronization in multiplayer scenarios without introducing overhead in single-player experiences, maintaining session continuity despite changes in user participation. Relocating the Physics Engine to an edge or cloud node reduces strain on local hardware, dedicating more resources to high-quality rendering and unlocking the full potential of untethered HMDs. We present four algorithms that decouple the physics engine, increasing frame rates and Quality of Experience (QoE) in VR simulations, supporting advanced interactions, numerous physics objects, and multiuser sessions with over 100 concurrent users...",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=79583170

AN EFFICIENT SYNCHRONIZATION MECHANISM FOR MIRRORED GAME ARCHITECTURES,"Cronin E., Kurc A.R., Filstrup B., Jamin S.",2004,1,,,Multimedia Tools and Applications . 2004. Т. 23. № 1 . С. 7-30.,"Existing online multiplayer games typically use a client-server model, which introduces added latency as well as a single bottleneck and single point of failure to the game. Distributed multiplayer games minimize latency and remove the bottleneck, but require special synchronization mechanisms to provide a consistent game for all players. Current synchronization methods have been borrowed from distributed military simulations and are not optimized for the requirements of fast-paced multiplayer games. In this paper we present a new synchronization mechanism, trailing state synchronization (TSS), which is designed around the requirements of distributed first-person shooter games. We look at TSS in the environment of a mirrored game architecture , which is a hybrid between traditional centralized architectures and the more scalable peer-to-peer architectures. Mirrored architectures allow for improved performance compared to client-server architectures while at the same time allowing for a greater degree of centralized administration than peer-to-peer architectures. We evaluate the performance of TSS and other synchronization methods through simulation and examine heuristics for selecting the synchronization delays needed for TSS.",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=6516973

INCORPORATING PERSONALIZED LEARNING IN A ROLE-PLAYING GAME ENVIRONMENT VIA SID MODEL: A PILOT STUDY OF IMPACT ON LEARNING PERFORMANCE AND COGNITIVE LOAD,,2022,1,,,Smart Learning Environments . 2022. Т. 9. № 1 . С. 1-18.,"While role-playing games and personalized learning have been regarded as effective tools to improve students’ learning, incorporating personalized learning into role-playing games is challenging and approaches are limited to cognitive and motivational variables. Aiming at expanding approaches to incorporate personalization into role-playing games, this study included affective and cognitive variables to develop a personalized role-playing game, guiding by the situational design model. A pilot study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the game on students’ learning performance and cognitive load. Results showed that personalized role-playing game environment was effective in improving students’ performance, reducing extraneous load, and promoting germane load. This study also found that although decreased extraneous load, could leave students more GL capacity for efficient learning, this would not necessarily lead to performance improvement. Students need to be motivated to invest sufficient germane load to actively process the learning materials and thus, improve performance. The findings have several implications for future research designing personalized educational games aimed to promote efficient learning.",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52075111
P2P MATCHMAKING SOLUTION FOR ONLINE GAMES,"Boroń M., Brzeziński J., Kobusińska A.",2020,1,,,Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications . 2020. Т. 13. № 1 . С. 137-150.,"Matchmaking players is an important problem in online multiplayer games. Existing solutions employ client-server architecture, which induces several problems. Those range from additional costs associated with infrastructure maintenance to inability to play the game once servers become unavailabe (due to being under Denial of Service attack or being shut down after earning enough profit). This paper aims to provide a solution for the problem of matchmaking players on the scale of the Internet, without using a central server. In order to achieve this goal, the SelfAid platform for building custom P2P matchmaking strategies is presented. After the developer creates a service algorithm defining the matchmaking behavior specific to his/hers case, the SelfAid platform designates a number of player machines to execute the service. Furthermore, the number of designated machines adapts to the demand. SelfAid uses only spare resources of player machines, following the trend of sharing economy. A distributed algorithm is presented and its correctness is proven.",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52903817
TRAFFIC MODELLING FOR FAST ACTION NETWORK GAMES,,2004,1,,,Multimedia Tools and Applications . 2004. Т. 23. № 1 . С. 31-46.,"A significant share of today's Internet traffic is generated by network gaming. This kind of traffic is interesting in regard to it's market potential as well as to it's real time requirements on the network. For the consideration of game traffic in network dimensioning, traffic models are required that allow to generate a characteristic load for analytical or simulative performance evaluation of networks. In this paper the fast action multiplayer game ""Counter Strike"" is evaluated based on one month of Internet traffic traces and traffic models for client and server are presented. The paper concludes with remarks on QoS metrics for an adequate assessment of performance evaluation results.",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=6516974

С. 507-533.,"Computer games are continuously improving graphics capabilities and game play, but the market demands show that more compelling gaming applications are required. In this article, the requirements of modern gaming applications are investigated and a classification of the most significant game design issues is presented. To understand the issues related to video and virtual reality gaming, an interactive game engine is designed and, as a case study, a traditional two-dimensional arcade game, called Breakout, is ported. Collision detection is supported between the graphics components of the application based on Newtonian laws of physics. To test the effectiveness of our approach, a tangible platform for playing interactive three-dimensional games using video see-through augmented reality techniques is proposed. To evaluate the effectiveness of each application, a pilot study was performed and the initial results of this study are presented.",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=11400926
ORGANIZING INNOVATIVE PROJECTS TO INTERACT WITH MARKET DYNAMICS: - A COEVOLUTIONARY APPROACH,"Van den Ende J., Wijnberg N., Vogels R., Kerstens M.",2003,3,,,European Management Journal . 2003. Т. 21. № 3 . С. 273-284.,"This paper is about the coevolutionary processes that take place between the way firms organize their innovative activities and the dynamics of the relevant markets, especially those having to do with bandwagon and network effects. We focus on the decision-making actors and propose a categorization of causes of increasing returns and definitions of bandwagon and network effects that are consistent with this aim. We investigate the extent of internal autonomy of the unit, the extent of the integration of R&D, production and other activities in the product development process, and the extent of external autonomy. Based on three cases of projects creating software products, two of them in the same firm, we develop hypotheses concerning the relation between the organization of innovation and bandwagon and network effects. Also, on the basis of the discussion of the cases and the coevolutionary framework, a number of research questions are formulated dealing with the relation between the organization of innovative activities by firms, bandwagon and network effects and long-term dynamics, especially of industry life-cycles.",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=5063150
"ROAM, A SEAMLESS APPLICATION FRAMEWORK","Chu H.H., Song H., Wong C., Kurakake S., Katagiri M.",2004,3,,,Journal of Systems and Software . 2004. Т. 69. № 3 . С. 209-226.,"One of the biggest challenges in future application development is device heterogeneity. In the future, we expect to see a rich variety of computing devices that can run applications. These devices have different capabilities in processors, memory, networking, screen sizes, input methods, and software libraries. We also expect that future users are likely to own many types of devices. Depending on users' changing situations and environments, they may choose to switch from one type of device to another that brings the best combination of application functionality and device mobility (size, weight, etc.). Based on this scenario, we have designed and implemented a seamless application framework called the Roam system that can both assist developers to build multi-platform applications that can run on heterogeneous devices and allow a user to move/migrate a running application among heterogeneous devices in an effortless manner. The Roam system is based on partitioning of an application into components and it automatically selects the most appropriate adaptation strategy at the component level for a target platform...",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=5122463
CONTEXTUAL VIRTUAL INTERACTION AS PART OF UBIQUITOUS GAME DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT,,2002,5-6,,,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing . 2002. Т. 6. № 5-6 . С. 390-406.,"This paper relates to the problems of designing rich interaction, in the context of multi-player games, that would adequately support communication, control and co-ordination. The aspects of fun and rich experiences, usually required within the entertainment context, are easily overlooked in technologically driven system design. The concepts of a future ubiquitous game can be difficult to comprehend and evaluate in cases where a fully functioning physical prototype is not an option. One solution for the problem is Contextual Virtual Reality Prototyping that adds the missing context to the design simulations. The product can be designed and demonstrated in the corresponding environment, thus making it easier to understand the use-cases of, for example, a mobile device that has various location-dependent features. The main contribution of this research is the design and development approach that supports the creation of rich interaction. The primary emphasis of the approach is to avoid purely technologically driven design and development, but rather to provide a supporting, or even a guiding, approach that focuses on the creative process and conceptual understanding of rich interaction. This conceptually grounded content production-oriented approach to interactive system design is described and evaluated.",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=1379308

LOW-COST VIRTUAL REALITY ENVIRONMENT FOR ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION,"Hilfert T., König M.",2016,1,,,Visualization in Engineering . 2016. Т. 4. № 1 . С. 1-18.,"Presenting significant building or engineering 3D-models is a crucial part of the planning, construction and maintenance phases in terms of collaboration and understanding. Especially in complex or large-scale models, immersion is one of the major key factors for being able to intuitively perceive all aspects of the scene. A fully immersive system needs to give the user a large field-of-view with reduced latency for lifelike impression. Technologies such as VRwalls and shutter glasses can deliver high refresh rates, yet fail to give a large field-of-view. Head-mounted-devices for virtual reality fill this gap. Head tracking mechanisms translate movements of the user’s head into virtual camera movements and enable a natural way of examining models. Unlike a stereoscopic representation with projectors, point-of-view tracking can be achieved separately for each individual user. Hardware costs for such systems were very high in the past, but have dropped due to virtual reality systems now gaining traction in the mainstream gaming community...",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52008076
NARRATIVE BALANCE MANAGEMENT IN AN INTELLIGENT BIOSAFETY TRAINING APPLICATION FOR IMPROVING USER PERFORMANCE,"Alvarez N., Sanchez-ruiz A., Cavazza M., Shigematsu M., Prendinger H.",2015,1,,,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education . 2015. Т. 25. № 1 . С. 35-59.,"The use of three-dimensional virtual environments in training applications supports the simulation of complex scenarios and realistic object behaviour. While these environments have the potential to provide an advanced training experience to students, it is difficult to design and manage a training session in real time due to the number of parameters to pay attention to: timing of events, difficulty, user’s actions and their consequences or eventualities are some examples. For that purpose, we have extended our virtual Bio-safety Laboratory application used for training biohazard procedures with a Narrative Manager. The Narrative Manager controls the simulation deciding which events will take place in the simulation, and when, by controlling the narrative balance of the session. Our hypothesis is that the Narrative Manager allows us to increase the number of tasks for the user to solve and, due to balancing difficulty and intensity, it keeps the user interested in training. When evaluating our system we observed that the Narrative Manager effectively introduces more tasks for the user to solve, and despite that, is accepted by the users as more interesting and not harder than an identical system without a Narrative Manager. Also, a knowledge test demonstrated better results in users’ interest and learning output in the narrative condition.",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52323350

EMOTECONTROL: AN INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR REAL-TIME CONTROL OF EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION IN MUSIC,"Micallef grimaud A., Eerola T.",2021,4,,,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing . 2021. Т. 25. № 4 . С. 677-689.,"Several computer systems have been designed for music emotion research that aim to identify how different structural or expressive cues of music influence the emotions conveyed by the music. However, most systems either operate offline by pre-rendering different variations of the music or operate in real-time but focus mostly on structural cues. We present a new interactive system called EmoteControl, which allows users to make changes to both structural and expressive cues (tempo, pitch, dynamics, articulation, brightness, and mode) of music in real-time. The purpose is to allow scholars to probe a variety of cues of emotional expression from non-expert participants who are unable to articulate or perform their expression of music in other ways. The benefits of the interactive system are particularly important in this topic as it offers a massive parameter space of emotion cues and levels for each emotion which is challenging to exhaustively explore without a dynamic system...",http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=52839581
