DECOUPLED EDGE PHYSICS ALGORITHMS FOR COLLABORATIVE XR SIMULATIONS,2024,статья в журнале - научная статья,"ABSTRACT. This work proposes a novel approach to transform any modern game engine pipeline, for optimized performance and enhanced user experiences in extended reality (XR) environments decoupling the physics engine from the game engine pipeline and using a client-server architecture creates a scalable solution, efficiently serving multiple graphics clients on head-mounted displays (HMDs) with a single physics engine on edge-cloud infrastructure. This approach ensures better synchronization in multiplayer scenarios without introducing overhead in single-player experiences, maintaining session continuity despite changes in user participation. Relocating the Physics Engine to an edge or cloud node reduces strain on local hardware, dedicating more resources to high-quality rendering and unlocking the full potential of untethered HMDs. We present four algorithms that decouple the physics engine, increasing frame rates and Quality of Experience (QoE) in VR simulations, supporting advanced interactions, numerous physics objects, and multiuser sessions with over 100 concurrent users...",да,http://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=79583170
